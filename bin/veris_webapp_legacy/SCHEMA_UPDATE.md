# Schema Update

1. Append version number to merged json schema and copy to assets/schema
2. Copy labels json over to assets/schema
3. In src/js/dbir-common.js

    - add imports for new schema.
    - change default version number
    - add section to schemas constant for new version

4. Add section for new version in src/js/veris_app.uiSchemas.js under each schema type. Remove any removed enumerations from ui:order, etc within each section for the version.  Add any new enumerations that may have been added so that they can be properly ordered and collapsable.

5. In assets/schema/veris_app_groom.json ensure the version number is included any any lists of moved items or the uiParsing will be inconsistant.

(Note: Steps 4 and 5 may take several iterations to get correct.  Try all combinations of schema/version in the webapp. Make sure to expand collapsed sections.)

OPTIONAL: Update packages:
(from within the webapp directory))
A. `npm install -g npm`
# per https://medium.com/@manjuladube/updating-each-dependency-in-package-json-to-the-latest-version-879836256939
B. `npm i -g npm-check-updates`
C. `npm-check-updates -u`
D. `npm install`
E. `npm audit fix`
This likely breaks things.  You'll then need to troubleshoot the JS.
NOTE: 20-11-23, I had to apply (https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin/commit/66de56497db33ad796705a18cb6a035006c7917d) patch manually to node_modules/html-webpack-inlie-source-plugin/index.js to fix an error outlined here: https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin/issues/57.

6. Run `npm run build:full` to minify the webapp and place it in the right spot. (you may have to run `npm install webpack`)
